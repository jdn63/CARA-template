## Getting Started

### Project Overview

CARA is a geospatial health and emergency preparedness risk assessment platform that:
- Serves 95 Wisconsin public health jurisdictions (including 11 tribal nations)
- Provides multi-domain risk scoring for natural hazards, infectious disease, and emergency preparedness
- Integrates real-time data from multiple government APIs
- Focuses on strategic long-term planning rather than emergency response

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git version control
- Basic understanding of Flask web development
- Familiarity with geospatial data (helpful but not required)
- Understanding of public health concepts (helpful but not required)

## Development Environment

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/cara-platform.git
   cd cara-platform
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Initialize database:**
   ```bash
   python -c "from core import create_app, db; app = create_app(); app.app_context().push(); db.create_all()"
   ```

6. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Testing Your Setup

```bash
# Run the test suite
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
make test

# Check code style
flake8 .

# Type checking (if you add type hints)
mypy .
```

## Code Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow **PEP 8** with these specific guidelines:

```python
# Good: Descriptive function names with docstrings
def calculate_risk_score(county_name: str, risk_type: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Calculate risk score for a specific county and risk type.
    
    Args:
        county_name (str): Name of Wisconsin county
        risk_type (str): Type of risk assessment
        
    Returns:
        Dict[str, float]: Risk assessment results
    """
    pass

# Good: Clear variable names
jurisdiction_count = len(wisconsin_jurisdictions)
heat_vulnerability_score = 0.75

# Avoid: Unclear abbreviations
jc = len(wj)  # Bad
hvs = 0.75    # Bad
```

### Documentation Requirements

**All functions and classes must include docstrings:**

```python
def process_census_data(api_key: str, fips_code: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Process census data for a specific geographic area.
    
    This function retrieves and processes demographic data from the US Census
    Bureau API for risk assessment calculations.
    
    Args:
        api_key (str): Valid Census Bureau API key
        fips_code (str): Federal Information Processing Standards code
        
    Returns:
        Dict: Processed census data including population, demographics,
              and housing characteristics
              
    Raises:
        ValueError: If FIPS code is invalid
        ConnectionError: If Census API is unavailable
        
    Example:
        >>> data = process_census_data("your_key", "55025")
        >>> print(data['population'])
        590875
    """
```

### Git Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>

# Examples:
feat(risk): add climate-adjusted heat risk calculation
fix(api): handle timeout errors in census data retrieval
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(utils): add tests for geo data processing
refactor(core): improve database connection handling
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

Create tests for all new functionality:

```python
# tests/test_risk_calculation.py
import pytest
from utils.risk_calculation import calculate_heat_risk

def test_heat_risk_calculation():
    """Test heat risk calculation for known county."""
    result = calculate_heat_risk("Dane", "high_heat_day")
    
    assert result['overall_risk'] > 0
    assert result['overall_risk'] <= 1.0
    assert 'exposure' in result
    assert 'vulnerability' in result
    assert 'resilience' in result

def test_heat_risk_invalid_county():
    """Test error handling for invalid county name."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        calculate_heat_risk("NonexistentCounty", "high_heat_day")
```

### Test Categories
